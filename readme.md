# BattleShip
This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum, focusing on developing apps with Test-Driven Development (TDD) concepts. The game is a console-based application without a graphical user interface, featuring a ship game.

## Components
1. Ship Factory Function (ship.js)
The Ship factory function creates ship objects for the game. It takes two parameters: name and length of the ship. The resulting object includes key/value pairs and functions:

#### hit()
A function to damage the ship. It increments the hits property.

#### isSunk()
A function to check whether the ship is sunk. It returns true if the ship is sunk, otherwise false.
